# ApeDB
### *A Database for Apes...*

ApeDB is a simple, fast, and powerful database program written in rust for the
modern world. With a custom and not-ugly query language along with a well
optimized binary-tree database structure it aims to be incredibly fast, on top
of having safe and secure defaults making database creation easily scalable and
preventing the need to re-write and re-structure anything down the road.
